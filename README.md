# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. Through engineering principals and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for user end.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):


Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
a.	The phase of inception: includes the planning and requirement analysis, and the creation of a rough draft of the system including identification of the possible risks. This is also the first step for risk management where project managers identify and prioritize software development risks.
b.	The design and prototyping phase of SDLC: is when the system designers take into account possible risks, so the list of potential risks the system has to deal with is formed at this stage.
c.	The implementation of the software development phase: includes the system configuration and creation of functional software, testing, and verification. Here the system is tested against the risks identified in the previous two phases.
d.	The maintenance phase: includes debugging and updating if new risks are identified they have to be included in the system modules.
e.	The audit phase: includes the risk management plan assessment and any necessary refinements. Any substantial changes in risk management are then incorporated into the updates based on system audit results.


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:


What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Requirements Engineering is the process of identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. 
Process and Importance
a.      Feasibility Study: Concentrates on below five mentioned areas below. Among these Economic Feasibility Study is the most important part of the feasibility analysis and the Legal Feasibility Study is less considered feasibility analysis.
b.      Requirements Specification: This activity is used to produce formal software requirement models. All the requirements including the functional as well as the non-functional requirements and the constraints are specified by these models in totality. During specification, more knowledge about the problem may be required which can again trigger the elicitation process. 
c.	Requirement Management: Process of analyzing, documenting, tracking, prioritizing, and agreeing on the requirement and controlling the communication with relevant stakeholders. This stage takes care of the changing nature of requirements.


Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
The concept of modularity is used primarily to reduce complexity by breaking a system into varying degrees of interdependence and independence across and "hide the complexity of each part behind an abstraction and interface".
By using modularity, you make your code more organized, reusable, and maintainable. It allows for parallel development and enhances collaboration among team members. If changes are needed, they can be made to individual modules without impacting the entire system.


Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
1.	Unit Testing: In this type of testing, errors are detected individually from every component or unit by individually testing the components or units of software to ensure that they are fit for use by the developers. It is the smallest testable part of the software. 
2.	Integration Testing: In this testing, two or more modules which are unit tested are integrated to test i.e., technique interacting components, and are then verified if these integrated modules work as per the expectation or not, and interface errors are also detected. 
3.	System Testing: In system testing, complete and integrated Softwares are tested i.e., all the system elements forming the system are tested as a whole to meet the requirements of the system. 
4.	Acceptance Testing: This is a kind of testing conducted to ensure that the requirements of the users are fulfilled before its delivery and that the software works correctly in the user’s working environment. 
Testing in software development is crucial for reducing project risk, providing confidence in the software quality, meeting compliance needs, ensuring satisfied users, enabling continuous improvement, and reducing overall costs.


What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter.
Examples 
1. GitHub
GitHub helps software teams to collaborate and maintain the entire history of code changes.
2. GitLab
GitLab comes with a lot of handy features like an integrated project, a project website, etc. Using the continuous integration (CI) capabilities of GitLab, you can automatically test and deliver the code.
3. Beanstalk
Beanstalk is an ideal option for those who need to work from remote places.
4. PerForce
Perforce delivers the version control capabilities through its HelixCore.


Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:
Software project managers serve as liaisons between the development team and the other stakeholders in a software project. They may be responsible for communicating project status, managing changes and requesting additional resources to help complete the project.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
Software Maintenance is the process of modifying, changing, and updating a software system or module to resolve errors, improve performance, or adapt to a changing environment. Software maintenance is one type of process, which helps to upgrade, modify, and update software to stay up with client needs
•	Corrective Software Maintenance – process of reinstating software to work efficiently
•	Adaptive Software Maintenance – reinstating a software to adapt with the functionalities that a user wants to undertake.
•	Perfective Software Maintenance - focuses on the evolution of requirements and features that existing in your system
•	Preventive Software Maintenance - helps to make changes and adaptations to your software so that it can work for a longer period of time


What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
  addictive design;
  corporate ownership of personal data;
  algorithmic bias;
  weak cyber security and personally identifiable information (PII) protection; and
  overemphasis on features.
Bug tracking and issue management
Bug tracking and issue management standards refer to the establishment of guidelines and processes for effectively managing bugs and issues in software development projects.
Secure coding practices
Secure coding practices are important for preventing security vulnerabilities in software. 
Documentation
Documentation is an important aspect of ensuring that software is maintainable and scalable.
